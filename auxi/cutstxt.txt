REMEMBER CHERIL WAS NO LONGER HAPPY
IN YE OLDE FOREST FAR AWAY,
SO SHE PACKED UP HER THINGS AND PARTED
TO THE BIG CITY IN DISARRAY.
AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED
JUST A WEEK AGO . . .
NOW CHERIL IS APPROACHING HER GOAL
BIG BUILDINGS ATOP THE HORIZON!
SHE SETS UP FOR A BETTER LIFE 
AWAY FROM MONKEYS AND 'SHROOMS.
BUT SHE CAN'T IMAGINE THE UGLY
SURPRISE AWAITING . . .
FOR EVERY STREET IS EMPTY, 
LONG SHADOWS AHOY!, SHE LAUGHS.
NO SOUND OF HUMAN ACTIVITY,
JUST A DEEP, DARK, EVIL GROWL . . .
SHE GOES UNNOTICED NO MORE!
A HUNDRED EYES TURNING TO HER . . .

'WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?'
CHERIL WONDERS LOUDLY (FOR GRANTED)
'OH, DIDN'T I MENTION IT?'
- TWAS THE MAYOR SPEAKING.
'OUR CITY IS DOOMED, CITIZENS HATH
TURNED INTO MONSTERS!!'
'WHAT KIND OF SORCERY IS THIS?
I'M OUT OF HERE. BYE BYE, EV'RYONE!'
- SAID CHERIL
'BUT YOU CAN'T - A SEAL HAS BEEN SET.
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO GO UNTIL YOU
DISPOSE OF EVERY UGLY BEING 'ERE'
'THEY ARE UNTOUCHABLE BUT VIBRATIONS
MAKE THEM STOP...
THOSE ODD CONTRAPTIONS WILL PAUSE
THEM FOR A WHILE! 
USE THEM WISELY AND JUMP OVER THEIR
HEADS!' - SAID THE MAYOR

'NOW THE STREETS ARE CLEAN'
- YELLED CHERIL.
'HATH I SEEN THAT, MA'AM'
- SAID THE MAYOR
'BUT YOUR JOB HERE IS NOT YET OVER,
HEAD TO THE OL' FACTORY, LADY!'
'WHADDAYA MEAN, UGLY OLD MAN?'
- PROTESTED CHERIL
'THERE'RE MORE MONSTERS IN THERE.
I'LL SAVE A MILLION IN WAGES,
BUT SOME CLEANUP IS DUE.'
- EXPLAINED THE MAYOR.
'I SHALL KILL YOU WITH MY BARE
HANDS, THIS I PROMISE!'
- EXPLODED CHERIL
'CALM DOWN AND WEIGHT YOUR
CHANCES - AND DO AS I SAY.'
- LAUGHED THE MAYOR.

'AND NOW I'M SO ANGRY I BURN!
LET ME GO AWAY, FILTHY SCUMBAG'
- SHOUTED CHERIL
'C'MON, MY LITTLE GIRL,
FOR I KNOW YOU ARE HAVING FUN
KICKIN' INCREDIBLE AMOUNTS OF ASS!'
'THAT MAY BE TRUE, BUT DOING THINGS
I DID NOT CHOOSE I HATE!'
'BUT YOU ARE ALMOST DONE, MYLADY!
SEE THAT DARK CAVE AHEAD? WE MINED
SOME CHEMICALS THERE. MAYBE THAT'S
WHY EVERYONE'S BEEN ACTING ODD!'
'OKAY, OKAY, MY MAYOR, 
I'LL CLEAN THAT CAVE FOR YOU AS WELL,
ONLY IF YOU PROMISE ME THIS IS THE
LAST JOB I HAVE TO DO!'
'SURE THING - CLEAN MY CAVE, 
THEN YOU MAY LEAVE'.

BUT AS CHERIL WENT OUT OF THE CAVE
ALL BADIES FALLEN, EVERYTHING DONE,
A STRANGE FIGURE APPEARED...
'WHAT'S THIS? I THOUGHT I'D FINISHED
EVERYONE ALREADY!' SAID CHERIL
'SNEE... SNEEE...' SAID THE THING.
'OH, MY GOD! CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!'
SAID THE MAYOR, 'IT'S A CREATURE OF 
PURE EVIL ORIGINATED FROM YOUR RAGE!
BE CAREFUL! MAY IT SNEEZE AND IT
WILL THROW YOU TO THE HELLISH
DIMMENSION!' - BUT IT WAS TOO LATE.
THE CREATURE SNEEZED, AND A TIDAL
WAVE OF PURE EVIL TWISTED REALITY.
'NOW YOU HAVE TO FIGHT BACK YOUR
WAY TO THE REAL WORLD', SAID THE
MAYOR. BUT HIS VOICE CAME FROM
FAR, FAR WAY...

CHERIL FOUND AN EVEN BIGGER AND
UGLIER CREATURE.
'TELL ME HOW TO GET BACK TO MY
WORLD, OR I'LL BEAT THE WORDS OUT
OF YOU!' - BUT THE CREATURE COULD
ONLY POINT SOMEWHERE IN THE FAR.
'THE FACTORY? AGAIN? PLEASE, NO!'
CRIED CHERIL.
'CLEAN THE FACTORY AGAIN', IT WAS
THE MAYOR SPEAKING FROM FAR AWAY,
'THAT WILL REDEEM YOU AND YOU'LL
BE FREE!'
'WELL, SO BE IT', SAID CHERIL
'I'M NOT HAVING A BAD TIME AFTER
ALL... ALL THIS ASS-KICKING IS
QUITE FUN.'
SO SHE ENTERED THE FACTORY... AGAIN
YET NOW EVERYTHING LOOKED DIFFERENT.

'SO THE TOWN IS CLEAN,
THE FACTORY IS CLEAN,
THE CAVE IS CLEAN...'
- ANNOUNCED CHERIL - 
' WHAT NEXT, DIRTY OLD MAN?
BEHOLD MY POWER! HA HA HA HA!'
'YOU SURELY ARE STRONG, MA'AM.'
- SAID THE MAYOR -
'YOU HAVE SERVED ME WELL. I SHALL
LET YOU GO. THE SEAL WILL BE LIFTED.
HONESTLY I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE
ABLE, BUT I WAS PROVED WRONG.'
'SO THAT'S ALL?' - SHOUTED CHERIL
'WHAT IS STOPPING ME FROM GETTING
UP THERE AND DESTROY YOUR CRANEUM
THE WAY I DID WITH ALL THOSE
MONSTERS OF YOURS?', 
'UH, I HAVE A PRIZE FOR YOU.'

'A PRIZE? OH, I'M NOT WORTHY...',
LIED CHERIL, FLATTERED.
'YUP, I AM OFFICIALLY OFFERING YOU
THE ONE AND ONLY COPA DEL MEAO,
'CAUSE QUIEN LA GANAO, SE LA LLEVAO,
QUIEN LA PERDIO, SE LA BEBIO'.
'I DON'T QUITE GET YOUR WORDS',
SAID CHERIL,
'BUT THAT'S FINE. THAT'S A HUGE CUP
AND THAT'S A SHITLOAD OF WEE!'
'YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU ARE GONNA
NEED IT, SAVE IT WELL!'
SO CHERIL WAS HAPPY, THE MAYOR WAS
HAPPY, AND EVERYTHING WAS COOL.
THAT'S THE WAY IT SHOULD BE.
AND NOW WHAT? WELL, NEW ADVENTURES
AWAIT CHERIL. JUST STAY TUNED!
THANKS FOR PLAYING!
